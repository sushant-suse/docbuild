Refactor how Git repository URLs are parsed and handled.
Previously, multiple regular expressions were used to identify different
URL formats (like HTTPS, SSH, plain, and abbreviated notations).
These have now been consolidated into a single, more robust regular expression.

Additionally, the :class:`~docbuild.model.repo.Repo` class was
enhanced with new attributes (:attr:`Repo.branch`, :attr:`Repo.origin`,
:attr:`Repo.treeurl`) to better manage repository details.
