The application now features comprehensive validation for the Environment Configuration (`env.toml`) using Pydantic. This ensures all configuration files strictly adhere to the required schema, enforcing correct data types for fields (for example, paths, URLs, network addresses) and immediately catching errors like missing keys or incorrect values. This change stabilizes the configuration loading process and eliminates runtime errors caused by misconfigured environments.
