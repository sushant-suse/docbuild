"""Concurrency utilities using producer-consumer patterns.

This module provides helpers for managing concurrent asyncio tasks with
strict concurrency limits, backpressure handling, and robust exception tracking.

It is designed to handle both I/O-bound tasks (via native asyncio coroutines) and
CPU-bound tasks (via `loop.run_in_executor`) while keeping resource usage deterministic.

    """Process items concurrently with bounded parallelism.

    Uses a producer/worker/consumer pipeline:

    - A single **producer** task feeds items into a bounded input queue.
    - ``limit`` **worker** tasks pull from the input queue, call ``worker_fn``,
      and push results into a bounded result queue.
    - The **caller** consumes results by iterating this async generator.

    All three stages run concurrently. Backpressure propagates naturally:
    a slow consumer stalls workers; stalled workers stall the producer.
    Order of results is NOT guaranteed.

    If ``worker_fn`` raises, the exception is wrapped in
    :class:`TaskFailedError` and yielded rather than re-raised, so one
    failing item does not abort the pipeline.

    Performance characteristics
    ---------------------------
    - **Throughput:** approaches ``limit * per-worker-throughput`` for
      I/O-bound workloads where workers spend most time awaiting external
      resources. CPU-bound work gains little due to the GIL; use
      ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` wrapped in ``asyncio.run_in_executor`` instead.
    - **Startup cost:** O(limit) — one asyncio task per worker, each cheap
      to create (~microseconds).
    - **Memory:** O(limit). Both the input queue (``maxsize=limit * 2``)
      and the result queue (``maxsize=limit * 2``) are bounded. At most
      ``limit`` items are in-flight inside workers at any time, giving a
      total live-item count of roughly ``5 * limit``.
      Note: each item itself may be arbitrarily large; the O(limit) bound
      refers to the *number* of items held in memory, not their byte size.
    - **Latency:** time-to-first-result equals one worker's latency.
      Remaining results stream out as workers complete, with no polling
      delay (sentinel-based signalling, zero busy-wait).
    - **Cancellation:** if the caller abandons the generator (e.g. ``break``
      in an ``async for`` loop), the internal runner task is cancelled and
      all worker tasks are cleaned up promptly via ``TaskGroup``.

    :param items: Iterable or async iterable of items to process.
    :param worker_fn: Async callable invoked as ``worker_fn(item)`` for
        each item. Must be safe to call concurrently from ``limit`` tasks.
    :param limit: Maximum number of concurrent workers. Must be >= 1.
        Higher values increase throughput up to the point where the event
        loop, network, or downstream service becomes the bottleneck.
    :param worker_args: Positional arguments to pass to ``worker_fn``.
    :param worker_kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to ``worker_fn``.
    :raises ValueError: If ``limit`` is less than 1.
    :yields: Results in completion order (not input order). Failed items
        are yielded as :class:`TaskFailedError` instances rather than
        raising, so the caller can handle partial failures inline.
