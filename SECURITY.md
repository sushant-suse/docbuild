# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates only for the latest development on the `main` branch. We recommend all users stay on the most recent commit or release to ensure they have the latest security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a potential security flaw in this project, please report it privately through GitHub's native reporting tool. This allows us to resolve the issue before information is made public, protecting our users.

### How to report?

1. Navigate to the **[Security](https://github.com/openSUSE/docbuild/security)** tab of this repository.
2. Click **Advisories** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Report a vulnerability** to open a private draft advisory.

Using this tool allows us to collaborate on a fix in a private workspace before disclosing the issue publicly.

## Automated Scanning

This repository uses **GitHub CodeQL** to automatically scan for vulnerabilities on every Pull Request. Results are monitored by the maintainers in the "Security" tab.
