.. Using IPython
   =============

This repository provides a convenient way to run :term:`IPython`
with the current environment, allowing you to easily import and
test the code without needing to modify the Python path.

To start an interactive IPython shell with pre-loaded project
modules, use the ``uipython`` alias (see :ref:`devel-helpers`).
This is useful for experimenting with the project's code and for debugging.

After the IPython shell is loaded, you can use the normal import without changing the import path:
